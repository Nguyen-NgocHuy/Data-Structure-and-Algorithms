    "# Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "###### A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stack can be created by both Array and Linked List\n",
    "- But which one is better for Stack or Queue?\n",
    "- Array allows something called __Cash Locality__, which makes them technically faster when accessing its items in memory because they are right newxt to each other versus Linked List, which has them scattered all over memory.\n",
    "- Linked List have extra memory associated with them because we have to hold on to those pointers. But they have more dynamic memory. Thus, we can keep adding things to the list versus an array where you have either a static array or dynamic\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The functions associated with stack are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __empty()__ – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "- __size()__ – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "- __top()__ – Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "- __push(a)__ – Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "- __pop()__ – Deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways from which a stack can be implemented in Python. This article covers the implementation of a stack using data structures and modules from the Python library. \n",

    "### Implementation using list\n",
    "Python’s built-in data structure list can be used as a stack. Instead of push(), append() is used to add elements to the top of the stack while pop() removes the element in LIFO order. \n",
    "Unfortunately, the list has a few shortcomings. The biggest issue is that it can run into speed issues as it grows. The items in the list are stored next to each other in memory, if the stack grows bigger than the block of memory that currently holds it, then Python needs to do some memory allocations. This can lead to some append() calls taking much longer than other ones.\n",
